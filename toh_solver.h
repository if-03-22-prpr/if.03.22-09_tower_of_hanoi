 * Author:			*/<your name>/*
 * ----------------------------------------------------------
 * Description:
 * The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical game or puzzle. 
 * The board consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes, which can slide onto any rod. 
 * At the beginning, all disks are placed on the left rod in ascending order of their size, the smallest disk at the top.
 * 
 * The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack of disks from the left to the right rod, obeying the following rules:
 * + Only one disk can be moved at a time.
 * + Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
 * + No larger disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
 * 
 * The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is 2n âˆ’ 1, where n is the number of disks.
